### WaveNet pytorch implementation
This code implements speech synthesis with WaveNet using pytorch. This code is partly translated from the tensorflow implementation: https://github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet

## Requirements
pytorch: 0.4.0

## Run
Run commands in runme.sh line by line. 

## Results

## FAQ
This code runs wtih a single GPU card with 12 GB memory. If you are running out of GPU memory, then modify Dataset to shorten the audio clip.
